CoreDataOptimizationExample
===
###Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to provide supporting examples for my blog post on optimizing CoreData. There are a series of tests in the file [TestFetchRequests](https://github.com/zackliston/CoreDataOptimizationExample/blob/master/CoreDataOptimizationExampleTests/TestFetchRequests.m) that show how to use the optimizations I describe. 

###Usage
In order to run these tests:
1: Clone or download the project to your computer<br>
2: Open the project in xcode<br>
3: Navigate to the TestFetchRequests.m file<br>
4: Run the tests by either using the shortcut cmd+u to run all tests, or clicking the empty diamonds next to the test signature that you would like to run. <br>
